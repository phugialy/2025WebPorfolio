Many find it useful for fast prototyping and getting immediate feedback. However, they also report challenges around code maintainability and reliability as projects grow.`n`nFor example, teams often start with vibe coding to validate ideas quickly but later face technical debt that slows down progress. This `"speed vs quality`" paradox means developers must carefully decide when to switch from vibe coding to more structured approaches.`n`n## Why It Matters`n`nUnderstanding vibe coding's benefits and pitfalls helps developers and teams make smarter decisions about their workflow. Balancing speed with quality leads to better software that can scale and adapt over time. This knowledge supports goals like efficient teamwork, sustainable codebases, and faster delivery without sacrificing maintainability.`n`n<SourceCard href=`"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00328`" label=`"Source: arXiv`" />"
