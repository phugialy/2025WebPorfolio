# Landing Page UX Hierarchy Analysis

## Current Structure

**Your 3 Main Components:**
1. **Me & My Info** (Personal intro/hero)
2. **Blog Post Features** (Latest from the blog)
3. **Project Showcase** (Featured projects only)

**Current Order:** Blog → Me → Projects (top-down)

---

## UX Principles to Consider

### 1. **Above the Fold (First Impression)**
- Users see this without scrolling
- Should establish **who you are** and **what you do**
- Should have a clear **call-to-action**

### 2. **Progressive Disclosure**
- Show most important first
- Build trust and credibility
- Lead to action (hire/contact)

### 3. **User Journey**
- **Recruiters**: Want to see work → skills → proof
- **Clients**: Want to see expertise → results → trust
- **Peers**: Want to see projects → blog → insights

   - Clear value proposition ("I build scalable applications...")
   - Stats and CTA visible right away

2. **Work is Proof**
   - Projects demonstrate capabilities better than words
   - Visual impact is stronger
   - Recruiters/clients want to see results first

3. **Blog Adds Depth**
   - After seeing work, blog shows thought process
   - Demonstrates expertise beyond code
   - Builds trust through knowledge sharing

### Suggested Order:

```
1. Hero Section (Me & My Info)
   ├─ Badge: "Software & Automation Engineer..."
   ├─ Heading: "I build scalable applications..."
   ├─ Description: Your specialization
   ├─ CTA Buttons: "View My Work" / "Get Free Quote"
   └─ Stats: 5+ Years, 20+ Projects, 98 Score
