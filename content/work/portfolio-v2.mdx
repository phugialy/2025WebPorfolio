# Portfolio Website v2: A Modern Web Experience

## Project Overview

A ground-up rebuild of my personal portfolio website, designed to showcase projects and technical writing while demonstrating expertise in modern web development practices.

### The Challenge

The previous portfolio lacked:
- Modern design and user experience
- Performance optimization (slow loading times)
- Proper SEO and accessibility features
- Content management system for blogging
- Mobile responsiveness

**Goal**: Create a high-performance, accessible, and maintainable portfolio that serves as both a showcase and a technical demonstration.

---

## Technical Stack

### Frontend
- **Next.js 15** (App Router) - React framework with server components
- **TypeScript** - Type safety throughout the application
- **Tailwind CSS 4** - Utility-first styling with custom design system
- **MDX** - Rich content authoring with embedded React components

### Backend
- **Convex** - Real-time database for contact forms and guestbook
- **Open-Meteo API** - Weather data integration

### Testing & CI/CD
- **Playwright** - End-to-end testing across browsers
- **GitHub Actions** - Automated testing and deployment
- **Vitest** - Unit testing framework

---

## Key Features

### 1. Performance Optimization

**Target Metrics Achieved:**
- LCP (Largest Contentful Paint): ≤ 2.0s ✓
- First Load JS: 122 kB (target: ≤180 kB) ✓
- Lighthouse Score: 95+ on mobile and desktop ✓

**Optimizations Applied:**
```typescript
// Code splitting per route
// Responsive images with WebP/AVIF
// Font optimization with next/font
// Static generation where possible
```

### 2. Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA Compliant)

- Full keyboard navigation
- Screen reader support with semantic HTML
- Focus management
- ARIA labels on interactive elements
- Color contrast ratios meeting standards
- Reduced motion support

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  * {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
  }
}
```

### 3. MDX-Powered Blog System

Custom blog implementation with:
- Frontmatter metadata (title, date, tags, summary)
- Syntax highlighting for code blocks
- Table of contents generation
- Reading time calculation
- Tag-based filtering

```typescript
// lib/posts.ts - Type-safe post management
export interface PostFrontmatter {
  title: string;
  date: string;
  tags?: string[];
  summary?: string;
  canonical_link?: string;
}
```

### 4. Auto-Blogging with GitHub Actions

Innovative RSS harvesting system that:
- Runs daily at 08:00 UTC via cron
- Fetches content from curated RSS feeds
- Creates MDX files with proper frontmatter
- Opens pull requests for review
- Prevents duplicates with hash tracking

**Workflow highlights:**
```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 8 * * *'  # Daily at 8 AM UTC
  workflow_dispatch:      # Manual trigger
```

### 5. Real-Time Features with Convex

**Contact Form:**
- Server-side validation
- Honeypot spam protection
- Rate limiting (5 requests/minute/IP)
- Success feedback

**Guestbook:**
- Public commenting system
- Moderation support
- Real-time updates
- Spam filtering with keyword detection

## Design System

### Typography
```typescript
const typography = {
  display: "Newsreader", // Serif for headings
  ui: "Inter",           // Sans-serif for body
};
```

### Color Palette
```typescript
const colors = {
  light: {
    background: "#ffffff",
    foreground: "#0a0a0a",
    primary: "#3b82f6",
  },
  dark: {
    background: "#0b0b0c",
    foreground: "#e5e7eb",
    primary: "#3b82f6",
  },
};
```

### Component Library
Custom components built with:
- Consistent API design
- Variant support (button, card, input)
- Dark mode compatibility
- Responsive behavior

---

## Development Process

### 1. Planning & Architecture (2 days)
- Defined information architecture
- Created design system
- Set performance targets
- Planned CI/CD pipeline

### 2. Implementation (8 days)
- Set up Next.js with TypeScript
- Built reusable component library
- Implemented all features
- Integrated Convex backend
- Created content structure

### 3. Testing & Optimization (2 days)
- Wrote Playwright E2E tests
- Performance auditing with Lighthouse
- Accessibility testing
- Cross-browser compatibility

### 4. Deployment & Documentation (2 days)
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Deployment to Vercel
- Documentation writing
- Final QA pass

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Bundle Size Optimization
**Problem**: Initial bundle size exceeded 200 kB

**Solution**:
- Code splitting by route
- Dynamic imports for heavy components
- Tree shaking unused code
- Font subsetting

**Result**: Reduced to 122 kB (32% under budget)

### Challenge 2: MDX Rendering Performance
**Problem**: Slow initial page load for blog posts

**Solution**:
- Server-side rendering with App Router
- Static generation for blog posts
- Incremental static regeneration
- Optimized MDX compilation

**Result**: 50% faster page loads

### Challenge 3: Rate Limiting Implementation
**Problem**: Needed to prevent API abuse without external services

**Solution**:
```typescript
// Simple in-memory rate limiter
export function checkRateLimit(
  identifier: string,
  maxRequests: number,
  windowMs: number
): boolean {
  const now = Date.now();
  const requests = rateLimitMap.get(identifier) || [];
  const recentRequests = requests.filter(
    (time) => now - time < windowMs
  );
  return recentRequests.length < maxRequests;
}
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Start with Performance**: Building performance in from the start is easier than optimizing later
2. **Accessibility = Better UX**: Accessibility improvements benefit all users
3. **Type Safety Matters**: TypeScript caught numerous bugs before deployment
4. **Automate Everything**: CI/CD saves time and prevents errors
5. **Document as You Go**: Real-time documentation is more accurate
